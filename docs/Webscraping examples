Example of a Blacklight webscraping source
Three parameters: label, base URL, and Query URL

Columbia University:
Label: Columbia (or whatever you want to use)
Base URL: https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog
Query URL: https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog?q=

If you want to manually add these to the config.json file, they look like this:

    "web_scraping_sources": {
        "Columbia": [
            "https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog?q=",
            "https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog"
        ]
    },
